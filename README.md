# NLP Data Curation

This repository contains the Python scripts used to scrape various Spanish websites for curating Spanish text data and performing data cleaning. <br>
The code used for deduplication can be found [here](https://github.com/AamodThakur/dedup_nlp). <br>

The curated data was later tokenized and used to pre-train a Transformer based model.
